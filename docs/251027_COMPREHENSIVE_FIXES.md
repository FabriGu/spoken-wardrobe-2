# Comprehensive Fixes - October 27, 2025

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: BodyPix Mask Quality (Holes)

**Root cause**: Warmup not effective - no camera feed during warmup

### Issue 2: Cage Dimensional Distortion

**Root cause**: BUG in `enhanced_cage_utils_v2.py` line 217

```python
y_max = min(frame_shape[1], y_max + padding_y)  # WRONG! Using width instead of height
```

### Issue 3: Mesh Pinching

**Root cause**: MVC weights pulling toward cage corners due to insufficient cage resolution

### Issue 4: Cage Segments Detaching

**Root cause**: Distance-weighted deformation allows independent movement

## Fixes

### Fix 1: Proper BodyPix Warmup with Camera Feed

- Show camera feed during warmup
- Run more warmup frames
- Remove morphological closing (was causing artifacts)

### Fix 2: Correct Cage Dimensions

- Fix y_max bug (use height not width)
- Add more cage vertices for smoother deformation
- Proper coordinate mapping

### Fix 3: Hierarchical Cage with Joint Constraints

- Keep cage segments connected at joints
- Use parent-child relationships for limbs
- Propagate transformations through hierarchy

### Fix 4: Smoother Cage Resolution

- Subdivide cage faces for more vertices
- Better MVC weight distribution
- Less pinching
