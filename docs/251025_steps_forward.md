# Real-Time Cage-Based Mesh Warping: Steps Forward

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Analysis & Implementation Plan

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

Current implementation shows mesh distortion ("flat smear") when user enters frame. Root cause: **improper cage structure and deformation logic**. The cage-based warping is not following anatomical structure as required by the research.

## üî¥ Current Problems Identified

### Problem 1: Non-Anatomical Cage Structure

```python
# CURRENT (WRONG): Generic cage generation
cage = cage_generator.generate_anatomical_cage(segmentation_data, ...)
# ‚Üí Produces ~400-500 vertices without clear anatomical boundaries
# ‚Üí No separation between torso, arms, legs
```

**Impact**: Can't deform body parts independently ‚Üí everything moves together ‚Üí smearing

### Problem 2: Incorrect Keypoint-to-Cage Mapping

```python
# CURRENT (WRONG): From keypoint_mapper.py line 130-215
cage_vertices += translation  # Translates entire cage uniformly
cage_vertices = alpha * cage_vertices + (1-alpha) * previous  # Just smoothing
```

**Impact**: Cage doesn't follow body articulation ‚Üí distortion

### Problem 3: MVC Weight Computation Unclear

From `test_integration.py`:

- Weights computed once in `initialize_cage_from_segmentation()` ‚úì
- But cage might be regenerated every frame ‚úó
- Dimension mismatches suggest cage size is changing

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Implementation Pipeline

### Phase 1: ONE-TIME SETUP (Offline/Initialization)

#### Step 1.1: Load 3D Clothing Mesh

```python
mesh = trimesh.load('generated_meshes/clothing.obj')
# mesh.vertices: [N, 3] - N vertices
# mesh.faces: [M, 3] - M triangular faces
```

#### Step 1.2: Generate Anatomical Cage

**Requirements** (from Le & Deng 2017):

- Low resolution (30-60 vertices total)
- Tightly bounds the mesh
- Respects anatomical topology

**Structure**:

```python
cage_structure = {
    'torso': {
        'vertices': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],  # 8 vertices
        'keypoints': ['left_shoulder', 'right_shoulder', 'left_hip', 'right_hip']
    },
    'left_upper_arm': {
        'vertices': [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],  # 6 vertices
        'keypoints': ['left_shoulder', 'left_elbow']
    },
    'right_upper_arm': {
        'vertices': [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
        'keypoints': ['right_shoulder', 'right_elbow']
    },
    'left_lower_arm': {
        'vertices': [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
        'keypoints': ['left_elbow', 'left_wrist']
    },
    'right_lower_arm': {
        'vertices': [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31],
        'keypoints': ['right_elbow', 'right_wrist']
    }
}
```

**Pseudocode**:

```python
def generate_anatomical_cage(mesh, bodypix_segmentation):
    """
    Generate cage with clear anatomical sections.

    Args:
        mesh: Trimesh object
        bodypix_segmentation: Dict with body part masks

    Returns:
        cage: Trimesh with ~30-60 vertices
        cage_structure: Dict mapping vertices to body parts
    """
    cage_vertices = []
    cage_structure = {}

    # For each body part (torso, arms, legs):
    for part_name, part_mask in bodypix_segmentation.items():
        # Find mesh vertices in this body part
        part_mesh_verts = get_vertices_in_mask(mesh, part_mask)

        # Create tight bounding cage section (6-8 vertices)
        part_cage_verts = create_cage_section(part_mesh_verts)

        # Store mapping
        start_idx = len(cage_vertices)
        cage_vertices.extend(part_cage_verts)
        end_idx = len(cage_vertices)

        cage_structure[part_name] = {
            'vertex_indices': list(range(start_idx, end_idx)),
            'keypoints': get_keypoints_for_part(part_name)
        }

    # Create cage mesh
    cage = create_mesh_from_sections(cage_vertices, cage_structure)

    return cage, cage_structure
```

#### Step 1.3: Compute Mean Value Coordinates (MVC Weights)

**ONE TIME COMPUTATION** - This is expensive (~10 seconds for 26k vertices)

**Mathematical Formula** (from Ju et al. 2005):

```
For point x and cage C with vertices {v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ, ..., v‚Çô}:

œâ‚±º(x) = [tan(Œ±‚±º‚Çã‚ÇÅ/2) + tan(Œ±‚±º/2)] / ||x - v‚±º||

where Œ±‚±º is the angle at x formed by edges to adjacent cage vertices
```

**Pseudocode**:

```python
def compute_mvc_weights(mesh_vertices, cage):
    """
    Compute Mean Value Coordinates for all mesh vertices.

    THIS IS EXPENSIVE - ONLY COMPUTE ONCE!

    Args:
        mesh_vertices: [N, 3] array of mesh vertex positions
        cage: Cage mesh with M vertices

    Returns:
        weights: [N, M] array where weights[i,j] = influence of
                 cage vertex j on mesh vertex i
    """
    N = len(mesh_vertices)
    M = len(cage.vertices)
    weights = np.zeros((N, M))

    print(f"Computing MVC weights for {N} mesh vertices...")

    for i, v in enumerate(mesh_vertices):
        if i % 1000 == 0:
            print(f"  Processing vertex {i}/{N}...")

        # For each cage vertex
        for j in range(M):
            # Compute angle-based weight
            weights[i, j] = compute_mvc_single_weight(
                v, cage.vertices[j], cage, j
            )

        # Normalize weights to sum to 1
        weights[i] /= weights[i].sum()

    print("‚úì MVC weights computed!")
    return weights
```

**Key Properties**:

- Weights are **constant** once computed
- Sum to 1 for each mesh vertex: `Œ£‚±º œâ‚±º(x) = 1`
- Depend only on relative position of mesh vertex to cage

---

### Phase 2: REAL-TIME LOOP (Every Frame)

#### Step 2.1: Get MediaPipe Keypoints (Fast - Already Works)

```python
results = pose.process(rgb_frame)
keypoints_2d = {
    'left_shoulder': [x, y, z],
    'right_shoulder': [x, y, z],
    'left_elbow': [x, y, z],
    # ... etc
}
```

#### Step 2.2: Map Keypoints ‚Üí Cage Vertex Deformation (CRITICAL!)

**This is where the magic happens - and where your code fails**

**Key Insight**: Each anatomical section of the cage deforms based on its corresponding keypoints

**Pseudocode**:

```python
def deform_cage_from_keypoints(
    original_cage_vertices,
    cage_structure,
    keypoints_2d,
    frame_shape
):
    """
    Deform cage by moving each anatomical section independently.

    Args:
        original_cage_vertices: [M, 3] original cage positions
        cage_structure: Dict mapping body parts to cage vertices
        keypoints_2d: Dict of MediaPipe keypoints
        frame_shape: (height, width) for normalization

    Returns:
        deformed_cage_vertices: [M, 3] new cage positions
    """
    deformed_cage = original_cage_vertices.copy()
    h, w = frame_shape[:2]

    # For each body part section:
    for part_name, part_info in cage_structure.items():
        cage_indices = part_info['vertex_indices']
        keypoint_names = part_info['keypoints']

        # Get keypoints for this part
        part_keypoints = [keypoints_2d[kp] for kp in keypoint_names]

        # Compute transformation for this section
        # (rotation + translation + scaling)
        transform = compute_section_transform(
            original_cage_vertices[cage_indices],
            part_keypoints,
            frame_shape
        )

        # Apply transformation to cage vertices in this section
        for idx in cage_indices:
            deformed_cage[idx] = apply_transform(
                original_cage_vertices[idx],
                transform
            )

    return deformed_cage

def compute_section_transform(section_cage_verts, keypoints, frame_shape):
    """
    Compute affine transform for a body part section.

    Example for arm:
    - keypoints = [shoulder, elbow]
    - Compute arm direction: elbow - shoulder
    - Compute arm length: ||elbow - shoulder||
    - Compute rotation to align cage with arm direction
    - Compute translation to move cage center to arm center
    """
    # Convert keypoints from pixels to normalized coordinates
    kp_normalized = normalize_keypoints(keypoints, frame_shape)

    # Compute center and orientation
    center = np.mean(kp_normalized, axis=0)
    direction = kp_normalized[1] - kp_normalized[0]  # e.g., elbow - shoulder
    length = np.linalg.norm(direction)

    # Compute cage section's current center and orientation
    cage_center = np.mean(section_cage_verts, axis=0)
    cage_direction = get_primary_axis(section_cage_verts)
    cage_length = get_section_length(section_cage_verts)

    # Build transformation matrix
    # 1. Rotation: align cage_direction with direction
    R = rotation_matrix_from_vectors(cage_direction, direction)

    # 2. Scale: match length
    s = length / cage_length

    # 3. Translation: move cage_center to center
    t = center - cage_center

    return {'rotation': R, 'scale': s, 'translation': t}
```

#### Step 2.3: Apply MVC Deformation (Fast!)

**This should be nearly instant** - just a matrix multiplication!

**Mathematical Formula**:

```
v'·µ¢ = Œ£‚±º œâ·µ¢‚±º ¬∑ c'‚±º

where:
  v'·µ¢ = deformed position of mesh vertex i
  œâ·µ¢‚±º = pre-computed MVC weight (from Step 1.3)
  c'‚±º = deformed position of cage vertex j (from Step 2.2)
```

**Pseudocode**:

```python
def deform_mesh_with_mvc(
    mvc_weights,
    deformed_cage_vertices
):
    """
    Apply cage deformation to mesh using pre-computed weights.

    THIS IS FAST - Just matrix multiplication!

    Args:
        mvc_weights: [N, M] pre-computed weights
        deformed_cage_vertices: [M, 3] deformed cage positions

    Returns:
        deformed_mesh_vertices: [N, 3] deformed mesh positions
    """
    # Simple matrix multiplication: [N, M] @ [M, 3] = [N, 3]
    deformed_vertices = mvc_weights @ deformed_cage_vertices

    return deformed_vertices
```

**Performance**:

- Input: 26,633 mesh vertices, 40 cage vertices
- Operation: (26633, 40) @ (40, 3) = (26633, 3)
- Time: ~1-2 milliseconds with NumPy

#### Step 2.4: Send to Web Viewer

```python
send_mesh_to_web(
    deformed_mesh_vertices,
    mesh.faces,
    cage_vertices=deformed_cage_vertices,
    cage_faces=cage.faces
)
```

## üéì Key Takeaways from Research

### From Le & Deng (2017):

> _"A high-quality cage for mesh deformation is expected to have the following desired qualities: (1) low resolution, (2) fully and tightly bound the model, (3) respect the topology of the enveloped model."_

**Application**: Our cage must have anatomical structure (torso, arms) not just be a bounding box.

### From Xu & Harada (2022):

> _"The core of cage-based deformation is cage coordinates, which represent the relative positions of spatial points w.r.t. the cage."_

**Application**: Pre-compute these coordinates once, then deformation is just matrix multiplication.

### From Ju et al. (2005) - Mean Value Coordinates:

> _"MVC provides a closed-form solution for cage coordinates with smooth interpolation properties."_

**Application**: We can compute weights in feedforward manner without iterative optimization.
