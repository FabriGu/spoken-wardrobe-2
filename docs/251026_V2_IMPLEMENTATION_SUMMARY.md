# Prototype V2 - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Implemented

I've completely rebuilt the cage-based mesh deformation system based on your correct understanding of the pipeline. Here's what changed:

---

## 🎯 Core Fixes

### 1. Cage Generated from SAME Image as Mesh ✅

**Problem (V1)**:

- Cage was generated from user's body in camera
- Different image than mesh generation
- Created cage for entire body even if mesh was just a shirt

**Solution (V2)**:

- Cage generated from saved reference data
- Same BodyPix segmentation used for mesh generation
- Cage only covers body parts where mesh exists

**Files**:

- `tests/enhanced_cage_utils_v2.py` - New cage generator
- `src/modules/ai_generation.py` - Added `save_reference_data()` method

---

### 2. Proper Coordinate System Handling ✅

**Problem (V1)**:

- Mixed coordinate systems (pixels, normalized, mesh space)
- Keypoints not properly converted
- Scaling caused mesh to disappear

**Solution (V2)**:

- Single mesh-centered normalized coordinate system
- Proper conversion: pixels → normalized → mesh space
- Keypoint deltas (not absolute positions)

**Files**:

- `tests/keypoint_mapper_v2.py` - Coordinate system handling

---

### 3. Section-Wise Cage Deformation ✅

**Problem (V1)**:

- All cage vertices moved together (uniform translation)
- Cage acted as rigid body
- No anatomical structure

**Solution (V2)**:

- Each body section (torso, left arm, etc.) deforms independently
- Relevant keypoints control each section
- Proper anatomical structure

**Key Logic**:

```python
# For each cage section (e.g., 'torso'):
relevant_keypoints = ['left_shoulder', 'right_shoulder', 'left_hip', 'right_hip']

# Compute mean movement of those keypoints
mean_delta = average(keypoint_deltas[relevant_keypoints])

# Apply only to vertices in that section
cage_section_vertices += mean_delta
```

---

### 4. 2D vs 3D Warping Toggle ✅

**Problem (V1)**:

- Always used Z-axis (which was incorrect)
- No way to test 2D warping separately

**Solution (V2)**:

- Default: 2D-only warping (X, Y only, Z fixed)
- Optional: `--enable-z-warp` for 3D (X, Y, Z)
- Allows validation of warping logic without Z calibration

---

### 5. No Automatic Scaling ✅

**Problem (V1)**:

- Automatic scaling made mesh too large/small
- Often disappeared offscreen

**Solution (V2)**:

- No automatic scaling
- Mesh stays at original size
- Debug logs show position for manual camera adjustment

---

### 6. Comprehensive Debug Logging ✅

**Problem (V1)**:

- Minimal debugging
- Hard to diagnose issues

**Solution (V2)**:

- Terminal debug logs every 2 seconds
- Web viewer real-time debug display
- Mesh bounds, camera position, visibility check
- Keypoint delta magnitudes

## ✅ What to Expect

### If Working Correctly:

1. **Mesh is visible** in web viewer (blue mesh)
2. **Cage is visible** (magenta wireframe around mesh)
3. **Moving left/right** → mesh warps left/right
4. **Moving up/down** → mesh warps up/down
5. **Debug logs show**:
   - Keypoints detected: 13/13
   - Delta magnitude changes when you move
   - Mesh position updates

### Terminal Debug Output (Example):

1. **Proper Camera Calibration**

   - Use Depth Anything or MiDaS
   - Calibrate MediaPipe Z-axis
   - Based on `tests/s0_consistent_skeleton_2D_3D.py`

2. **Dynamic Mesh Scaling**

   - Scale mesh to match user's body size
   - Use keypoint spread ratios

3. **Rigid Transformation**

   - Handle rotation + scale + translation
   - Use Kabsch algorithm (SVD)

4. **Partial Clothing Support**
   - Dynamic cage generation based on mesh coverage
   - Ignore irrelevant keypoints

## 📊 Testing Checklist

Use this to validate V2 works:

- [ ] Reference data created successfully
- [ ] System starts without errors
- [ ] WebSocket connects
- [ ] Mesh visible in web viewer
- [ ] Cage visible (magenta wireframe)
- [ ] Mesh warps left when you move left
- [ ] Mesh warps right when you move right
- [ ] Mesh warps up when you move up
- [ ] Mesh warps down when you move down
- [ ] Debug logs show keypoint deltas
- [ ] FPS is 20-30

---

## 🔍 Validation Goals

**Primary Goal**: Verify that warping logic is correct

V2 does NOT need:

- ❌ Perfect alignment with user
- ❌ Correct scaling
- ❌ Correct Z-axis depth
- ❌ Smooth/jitter-free movement
- ❌ Rotation handling

V2 MUST demonstrate:

- ✅ Mesh deforms (not rigid)
- ✅ Movement direction is correct (left → left, up → up)
- ✅ Different body parts move independently
- ✅ Cage structure is anatomical

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Expected)

These are acceptable in V2 prototype:

1. **Z-axis incorrect** - MediaPipe Z is uncalibrated
2. **Mesh may be wrong size** - No automatic scaling
3. **No rotation** - Only handles translation
4. **Jittering** - No temporal smoothing
5. **Doesn't match user scale** - Need calibration

**Focus**: Does the mesh warp in the correct direction when you move?

## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### Why "Reference Data"?

**Problem**: We need cage to match mesh, but:

- Mesh generated from image A
- Cage generated from image B (user in camera)
- Different poses/positions → inconsistent

**Solution**: Save data from image A:

- BodyPix segmentation
- MediaPipe keypoints
- Use this to generate cage → consistency guaranteed

### Why "Delta" Instead of Absolute Position?

**Problem**: Absolute keypoint positions don't work:

- Reference pose: shoulder at (0.35, 0.3)
- Current pose: shoulder at (0.45, 0.3)
- If we set cage = (0.45, 0.3), cage jumps around

**Solution**: Use delta (change):

- Delta = current - reference = (0.1, 0.0)
- Apply: cage += delta
- Smooth relative movement

### Why Section-Wise Deformation?

**Problem**: Uniform translation = rigid body:

- All cage vertices move same amount
- Mesh doesn't deform, just translates
- Looks like sliding texture

**Solution**: Independent sections:

- Torso moves based on shoulder/hip keypoints
- Left arm moves based on shoulder/elbow keypoints
- Right arm moves based on shoulder/elbow keypoints
- Result: Mesh actually deforms

## 📞 Need Help?

### If Mesh Not Visible

1. Check debug logs for "OFFSCREEN" warning
2. Use WASD + mouse to navigate camera
3. Press R to reset camera
4. Check "Mesh Position" in debug logs

### If Mesh Doesn't Warp

1. Check "Keypoints detected" in debug logs (should be > 0)
2. Check "Delta magnitude" (should change when you move)
3. Try better lighting
4. Try different distance from camera

### If WebSocket Fails

1. Check port 8765 is available
2. Check terminal for "✓ WebSocket server started"
3. Restart Python script
4. Check browser console for errors

---

## 🎯 Success Metric

**V2 is successful if**:

> When you move left, the mesh warps left.  
> When you move right, the mesh warps right.  
> When you move up, the mesh warps up.  
> When you move down, the mesh warps down.

That's it! Everything else (scaling, Z-axis, smoothness) comes later.
